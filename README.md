# express-skeleton

üëã Welcome to express-skeleton, part of the [Project Calavera](https://github.com/project-calavera). Express-skeleton is a starter template(skeleton) for [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) based apps and websites.

## What is this repository?

This repository allows you to quickly scaffold a basic Expressjs project using the [Pug templating](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) language. It provides the following:

Once [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository), either directly, or a repository that uses this one as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), it allows you to simply run `npm i` or `yarn` to install the dependencies you will need.

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.16",
  "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.5"
},
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.1",
  "pug": "^3.0.2"
}
```

The `pckage.json` that comes with the project also has the following NPM script targets:

```json
"build": "parcel views/index.pug",
"start": "nodemon app.js",
```

> NOTE: Remember to update the `package.json` with information about your project.

It also contains a basic `.gitignore` file as well as a default configuration(`.prettierrc`) for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
It contains a [single `route`](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/blob/main/routes/router.js) that will serve your [index](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/tree/main/views) file.

The project also contains an empty [`main.js`](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/blob/main/static/js/main.js) file, which is already being included for you inside the [footer partial](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/blob/main/views/includes/footer.pug). There is also a [head.pug](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/blob/main/views/includes/head.pug) file that contains basic elements that goes into the `head` of your HTML document. This then also loads the [CSS file](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/blob/main/static/style/main.css) from the static folder.

The project also includes a [`.github` folder](https://github.com/project-calavera/express-skeleton/tree/main/.github) with the following:

- dependabot.yml - Setup to automatically keep the [project dependencies up to date](https://github.com/dependabot).
- workflows/auto-merge.yml - This will automatically merge Dependabot pull request that are not a major version bump and, should all your CI tests and workflows pass. To use this, you will also need to configure a repository [environmental secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) that has repo scope.

## Why is it useful?

If you often start new projects that uses Expressjs, Pug and the [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/) this will definitely save you at least an hour of your day. That is nothing to sneeze at right? üòÅ
